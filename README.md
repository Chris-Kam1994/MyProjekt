# MyProjekt
Program for copying folder and file structures of web applications projects and automatically converting TypeScript files to JavaScript. 
After conversion, the original TypeScript files remain in the project folder while the files converted to JavaScript are copied to the new folder. 
Finally, a previously selected file, for example an index.html, is executed.
